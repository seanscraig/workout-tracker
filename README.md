  ## Description
  This is a worker tracker, where a user is able to view, create and track daily workouts. They are able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. They are also able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, they are able to track their distance traveled.
